# Personal Study Templates

## Overview

Welcome to the Personal Study Templates repository! This collection of HTML templates and automation scripts is designed to assist learners in creating personalized quizzes, flashcards, and exams for effective memorization and learning. Each template is adaptable, allowing for customization to fit individual study needs and various educational contexts. The addition of an R script for generating flashcards from an Excel spreadsheet makes it even easier to create study materials without needing to edit HTML directly.

## Templates Included

-   **Flashcards**: A set of flashcards for quick memorization of facts and concepts. Includes an R script (`HTML-Modifier-R`) that allows you to create flashcards by simply filling out a spreadsheet in Excel.
-   **Exams**: Simulated exam templates to practice under test conditions.

## Usage

These templates are intended for personal use to aid in memorization and learning. The Flashcards template can be easily generated by filling out the provided Excel template in the `HTML-Modifier-R` folder and running the R script. This process converts your input into an interactive flashcard set, which can be viewed in any standard web browser. Feel free to adapt and modify the HTML templates and the R script as you see fit for your educational endeavors.

### Creating Flashcards with R Script

1.  Ensure you have R installed on your computer.
2.  Place your content in the Excel template located in the `HTML-Modifier-R` folder.
3.  Run the R script to generate your interactive flashcards.
4.  Open the resulting HTML file in a browser to view and interact with your flashcards.
